## Description

Ever see one of these [memes](http://twistedsifter.com/2016/03/puppy-or-bagel-meme-gallery/)?

Hidden Hounds is a game where you find the animal hidden amongst the food items. It's actually a lot harder then it may seem. It takes about 10 seconds for the blurred images to become clear. You gain more points the faster you select the animal, but you loose 25 points for incorrect guesses. 

## Inspiration

Hidden Hounds was inspired by a couple of viral Internet memes, called "Canine or Cuisine". It was entertaining to see how much chicken wings resembles a doodle. The best meme I've come across is chocolate croissant resembling a sloth's face.

Being a cat lover, I added a cat to the last level to change it up.
